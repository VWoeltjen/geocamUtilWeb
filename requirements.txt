# geocamUtil is a "kitchen-sink" repo of miscellaneous utilities.  In
# order to use *all* of the utilities, you would need to install all of
# the third-party dependencies below. However, some parts of geocamUtil
# function without *any* dependencies. Therefore, we're currently
# configuring it so that 'pip install geocamUtil' won't auto-install
# dependencies, giving you full flexibility to manually install only
# what you need.
